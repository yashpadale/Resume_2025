Projects: 
Object Detection on Architectural Floor Plan: 
• Developed an object detection system for architectural floor plans using YOLOv8 
model, achieving high accuracy in identifying elements like columns, walls, doors, and 
windows. 
• Utilized PyTorch for model training, YAML for dataset organization, and Streamlit for 
web UI, ensuring efficient development and user-friendly interface. 
• Demonstrated system's capabilities through a Streamlit web application enabling users 
to upload floor plan images, adjust detection parameters, and export results to CSV. 
• Contributed to architectural design optimization, construction planning, and real estate 
evaluation by automating analysis of floor plans, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in 
these domains. 
Used Transformer Model for creating chatbot: 
• Created a robust solution to use multi head attention model to train on sequence 
to sequence models for creating a chatbot by referring to research paper- Attention is 
All you need using Keras. 
• Designed the model with an encoder-decoder structure to handle the sequence- 
to-sequence nature of conversational data. 
• Applied text tokenization techniques to convert conversational data into 
numerical format. 
Used Open Cv : 
• Developed an innovative web-based attendance management system leveraging 
OpenCV for facial recognition and liveness detection, ensuring robust and secure 
attendance marking. The system is built using Flask for backend development and 
integrates various technologies to provide a comprehensive solution. 
• Connected the application to Google Sheets for storing attendance data, 
providing a cloud-based solution for easy access and management. 
• Employed HTML5 Geolocation API to capture the latitude and longitude of the 
user’s location at the time of attendance marking. 
• Utilized Haar cascades and deep learning models for accurate face detection. 
Created speech to text model: 
• Developed an advanced speech-to-text model using Keras to convert spoken 
English into written text. The project involved extensive data analysis on audio 
spectrograms and text transcripts, implementing cutting-edge techniques such as 
custom learning rate schedulers and attention mechanisms to enhance model 
performance. 
• Used Custom Learning Rate scheduler and learnt the casual attention 
mechanism and greedy attention mechanism .

Trained Transformer model To mimic writing Style: 
• Trained a Transformer model using Keras to mimic the writing style of J.K. 
Rowling, focusing on capturing the linguistic nuances of the Harry Potter series. 
• Achieved notable success in generating text that is not only grammatically 
correct but also stylistically consistent with the author's unique style. 
• Implemented advanced sequence-to-sequence learning techniques, enabling the model 
to predict the next 5 to 6 tokens accurately. 
• Applied text augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity and richness of the 
training data, improving model performance. 
Trained Transformer model To Transliterate: 
• Model Training and Implementation: Trained a Transformer model using Keras to 
convert Marathi sentences into English transliterations, focusing on phonetic accuracy. 
• Data Collection and Preprocessing: Manually collected and preprocessed a dataset of 
Marathi sentences with corresponding English transliterations, applying normalization 
and tokenization techniques. 
• Evaluation and Performance: Evaluated the model's performance, achieving high 
accuracy in phonetic consistency and transliteration accuracy. 
• Practical Application: Developed an application to convert Marathi sentences into 
English transliterations, providing documentation and use cases to demonstrate 
effectiveness.

Achievement: 
1] 
Won Hackathon Conducted at Savitrabai Phule Pune University of 2023 
•  Created a naïve bayes model to classify text based on their class and called diff functions which 
would do the operations on data whether csv , excel , json etc with help of pandas library and 
matplotlib and seaborn to create visuals and connected the frontend to backend , designed the 
UI , managed the storage and retrieval of files uploaded by user.

Won Hackathon Conducted at Savitrabai Phule Pune University of 2024 
• Created a Transformer model from numpy , keras , tensorflow and trained it on customer 
support conversation so that the model can automate customer conversation text based. Which 
can later be scaled for powering the conversation of customer call centre service automation 
through AI .
